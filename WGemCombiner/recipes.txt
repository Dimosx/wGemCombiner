# You can put any custom recipes you may have in this file. Recipes can use
# either parenthetical or equation notation, and equations can use or omit the
# "val" comment. Equation recipes must be separated from one another by a blank
# line. Parenthetical recipes do not require this. Recipe lines beginning with
# either # or // will be ignored, but these should not be used mid-line.
#
# Examples:
# (((o+o)+o)+o)+(o+o)
# ((2m+m)+m)+m
# 0=y
# 1=b
# 2=r
# 3=0+1
# 4=3+2
# 
# (val=1)	0=o
# (val=2)	1=0+0
# (val=3)	2=1+0
