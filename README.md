WGemCombiner
========

In-game gem combiner bot for [Gemcraft 2: Chasing Shadows](http://gameinabottle.com/).


### Get WGemCombiner:

Head to the [Release page] (https://github.com/gemforce-team/wGemCombiner/releases) to download the last version of the program.  
At the moment we only have a working Windows version.


### How To:

You give a gem recipe (or use one of the preset ones), put base gems on the correct starting slots
and the program sends mouse/keyboard events to the system to perform it in game automatically.  
There is an extensive help inside the program.


### Report bugs:

To report a bug with wGemCombiner look at the
[Issues page on Github](https://github.com/gemforce-team/wGemCombiner/issues) if it was already reported.  
If your bug isn't there open a [new issue](https://github.com/gemforce-team/wGemCombiner/issues/new).
Be sure to include all the relevant information (OS, wGC version, etc...) and give a reliable way to reproduce the bug.
A video of the combiner in action could also help immensely, but it's not necessary.
